Data Structures is about how data can be stored in different structures

Trees

How to traverse a tree and display its content
1. Depth-first-search (DFS) is a technique that visits the first child in the children list and that node’s children recursively before visiting all the first child’s siblings and then their children recursively
2. breadth-first (BFS) is a technique in a tree that visits all children of a node first before visiting any further levels.
